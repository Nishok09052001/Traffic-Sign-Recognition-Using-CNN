# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Using-CNN

### You can download the data-set from https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

## Objective :
The objective of the Traffic Sign Recognition project is to build a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which is used to classify traffic signs. We should train the model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. 
This data should be firstly preprocessed in order to maximize the model performance. After choosing model architecture, fine tuning and training, the model will be tested on new images of traffic signs found on the web. Because we deal with images classification, a Convolutional Neural Network is chosen, which is a common choice for this type of problems.

## Project Pipeline:
* Loading the data
* Image preprocessing
* Designing, training and testing a CNN model
* Using the model on new images
